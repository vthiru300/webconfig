      <description>The image above is the picture of the heart rate monitor I made during my 2nd year of my undergraduate. I was very intrigued by the way in which the pulse from the body was detected and processed into a wave via a myriad of circuits. It opened up doors for me to navigate through embedded systems, signal processing, image processing and C coding which I would learn in the later semesters.</description>
