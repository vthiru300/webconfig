      <description>Ignition The picture(in the banner)represents one of the early experiences I had with machines near one of the subway stations in Tokyo. Apart from using the ticketing systems in buses and trains in Japan, I had the opportunity to use vending machines and automated ordering systems in restaurants. As a child, I was fond of using these machines/devices. At school, every Friday, we were allowed to get money to vend-out our favorite drink after lunch.</description>

      <description>Abstract The image above is the picture of the heart rate monitor I made during my 2nd year of my undergraduate. I was very intrigued by the way in which the pulse from the body was detected and processed into a wave via a myriad of circuits. It opened up doors for me to navigate through embedded systems, signal processing, image processing and C coding which I would learn in the later semesters.</description>
