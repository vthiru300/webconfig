      <description>The spark The picture represents one of the early experiences I had with machines. Apart from using the ticketing systems in buses and trains in Japan, I had the opportunity to use vending machines and automated ordering systems in restaurants. As a child, I was fond of using these systems. At school, every Friday, we were allowed to get money to vend-out our favorite drink after lunch. I would find every opportunity to make my parents buy food or a drink from these machines.</description>
