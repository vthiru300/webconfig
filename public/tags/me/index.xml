      <description>Ignition The picture(in the banner)represents one of the early experiences I had with machines near one of the subway stations in Tokyo. Apart from using the ticketing systems in buses and trains in Japan, I had the opportunity to use vending machines and automated ordering systems in restaurants. As a child, I was fond of using these machines/devices. At school, every Friday, we were allowed to get money to vend-out our favorite drink after lunch.</description>
