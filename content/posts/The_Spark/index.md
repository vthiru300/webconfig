## Ignition
##### The picture represents one of the early experiences I had with machines near one of the subway stations in Tokyo. Apart from using the ticketing systems in buses and trains in Japan, I had the opportunity to use vending machines and automated ordering systems in restaurants. As a child, I was fond of using these machines/devices. At school, every Friday, we were allowed to get money to vend-out our favorite drink after lunch. I would find every opportunity to  make my parents buy food or a drink from these machines. I was extremely amused to have made this the topic of my final year project. Although these machines are readily available, recreating this machine created an opportunity to build the skill of integration and understanding the way embedded systems work. The process of separately testing each component and integrating all of them with code enabled us to hone and gain confidence on the subject we learned as a part of the curriculum.

##### This is the toy I bough back when I was a child in Japan, it served as an inspiration for the project.

#### Future-Scope
##### We thought to take our recreation one step further, we made a model which wpuld optimize the use of power and the number of motors using a mechanical multiplexer. We got this idea from visiting https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3154074 . We were able to 3D print the model and were successfully able to make a working prototype model.
