The image above is the picture of the heart rate monitor I made during my 2nd year of my undergraduate. I was very intrigued by the way in which the pulse from the body was detected and processed into a wave via a myriad of circuits. It opened up doors for me to navigate through embedded systems, signal processing, image processing and C coding which I would learn in the later semesters. I made quite a lot of errors and mistakes which were at first hard to understand and detect. With persistent effort and diligence, I was able to make the circuit work and this entire experience gave me the confidence to pursue my interests in embedded systems and image processing further. This project helped me transit from high school level mini projects to undergraduate level projects.
