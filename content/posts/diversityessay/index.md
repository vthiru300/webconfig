## Essay
Diversity resonates with me on many levels; I have had the privilege of growing up in a multicultural environment. As a native of India, my country is well-known for its diversity in languages, cultures and traditions. I have spent most of my childhood in Japan around people from various walks of life. I feel lucky to have a friend living in a different country and sharing their experiences with people. I returned to India at the age of 10 due to my father receiving a job transfer at the time. I have been living in Bangalore for almost about 15 years now. Bangalore is popularly known as the “Tech Hub” or “India’s Silicon Valley”. You can expect to find people from all over the country flocking to settle here for its pleasant weather and promising opportunities. I’ve made numerous friends belonging to almost every state in the country. My unique experiences led me to value cultural, gender and regional diversity.

I am very grateful to have made friends at school who had been very accepting despite the difference in mannerisms and cultural backgrounds. At first, I had difficulties communicating my thoughts and ideas to my teachers and found myself putting in extra effort to convey information. Later with the encouragement and acceptance of my peers and teachers, I was able to cope up with learning subjects, ideas, and other information. 

The hardest challenge I faced was when I was pursuing my undergraduate course. I had initially found it difficult to make friends because I found it very hard to find a common ground. Like most adolescents, I had a major identity crisis. I did not understand the biases I had towards situations and people in general. I had a lot of questions to which answers weren’t readily available. I got opportunities to conduct department quizzes, small events as well as mentor juniors with the acquired skills I got from internships. This helped me get most of the answers to my questions. I started connecting with people outside my department and exchanged ideas, problems, solutions and expanded my view towards situations.

After I joined as a Project Engineer at my current workplace Wipro, I had to learn to adapt to the challenges presented. This time I wanted to figure out a principle-centred method to adapt that would be easy to understand and applicable in every situation. I had a hard time gelling with my colleagues as there was a tremendous difference in opinion and mindset. Luckily after coming across the book “7 Habits of Highly Effective People” by Stephen Covey, I was able to navigate through situations arising in my workplace and gradually deal with change. I also have the opportunity to pursue fine arts as a hobby, it has catalyzed the process of accepting people and situations and enabled me to find the path that leads to peace within.
